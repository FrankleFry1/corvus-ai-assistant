Overview
CORVUS is a Python-based AI assistant designed to manage and automate tasks for both computer control and homestead activities. It integrates voice recognition, web searches, system monitoring, and advanced data analysis (e.g., neutrino signal detection) to provide a versatile assistant for users. The project showcases advanced Python programming skills, including data processing, natural language processing (NLP), and integration with external APIs and libraries.
Purpose
CORVUS aims to:
Automate routine computer tasks (e.g., opening applications, typing text).
Provide homestead-specific functionalities like weather updates and gardening tips.
Perform advanced scientific analysis, such as detecting potential artificial neutrino signals near Proxima Centauri.
Demonstrate modularity, error handling, and self-modification capabilities in Python.
Key Features
Command Processing:
Supports a variety of commands like open chrome, type hello, cpu, weather, take picture, analyze neutrinos, and more.
Uses an allowlist (ALLOWED_ACTIONS) to ensure safe command execution.
Tracks command usage and suggests frequently used commands.
Voice Recognition:
Integrates speech_recognition and vosk for local text and potential voice input.
Allows dynamic adjustment of voice recognition parameters for improved accuracy.
Web Search and Caching:
Uses SerpAPI to fetch real-time web data with prioritized sources (e.g., gardening, agriculture).
Caches search results to optimize performance and reduce API calls.
Computer Vision:
Utilizes YOLOv8 (ultralytics) for object detection in images.
Includes fallback color analysis for identifying objects like gourds when specific objects are not detected.
System Monitoring:
Monitors CPU and memory usage with psutil.
Diagnoses issues like API connectivity or file permission errors.
Neutrino Data Analysis:
Analyzes IceCube neutrino data to detect potential artificial signals near Proxima Centauri.
Uses pandas, numpy, scipy, and astropy for data processing and FFT-based temporal analysis.
Saves results to a JSON file and supports email notifications for high-scoring signals.
Self-Modification:
Allows adding new commands and optimizing web search or voice recognition settings dynamically.
Creates backups before modifying the source code to ensure safety.
Flask API:
Provides a RESTful API for remote command execution (e.g., via phone).
Runs on a separate thread for concurrent command processing.
Dependencies
Python 3.8+
Libraries: speech_recognition, pyautogui, psutil, flask, requests, opencv-python, ultralytics, vosk, sounddevice, shutil, pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, astropy
External Services:
SerpAPI for web searches (API key required).
Optional: OpenWeatherMap for weather updates (API key required).
Vosk model: vosk-model-small-en-us for voice recognition (update path in code).
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd corvus
Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Paths:
Update file paths in corvus_control.py (e.g., HISTORY_FILE, IMAGE_PATH, SCAN_DIRECTORY, REMINDERS_FILE, SOURCE_FILE, BACKUP_FILE, vosk_model).
Ensure the Vosk model is downloaded and placed in the specified directory.
Set API Keys:
Replace api_key in search_web and diagnose_issues with a valid SerpAPI key.
Optionally, configure an OpenWeatherMap API key in the weather command.
Run the Application:
python corvus_control.py
Access the Flask API:
The Flask server runs on http://0.0.0.0:5000.
Send POST requests to /command with JSON payload: {"command": "your_command_here"}.
Usage Examples
Basic Commands:
Enter command: open notepad
# Opens Notepad on Windows.
Enter command: type Hello, world!
# Types "Hello, world!" into the active window.
Enter command: cpu
# Displays CPU and memory usage.
Homestead Commands:
Enter command: local weather
# Fetches weather forecast for Cleveland, TN.
Enter command: gardening tips for tomatoes
# Searches for tomato gardening tips.
Advanced Analysis:
Enter command: analyze neutrinos
# Analyzes neutrino data and reports potential artificial signals.
Self-Modification:
Enter command: add command check battery
# Adds a new command and restarts the script.
Enter command: optimize web search
# Increases web snippet length and adds agriculture to source priority.
Code Quality and Python Skills
This project demonstrates:
Modularity: Functions are organized for specific tasks (e.g., execute_command, analyze_neutrinos, search_web).
Error Handling: Extensive try-except blocks ensure robust execution and user-friendly error messages.
Data Processing: Advanced analysis with pandas, numpy, scipy, and astropy for neutrino signal detection.
NLP: Command parsing and normalization for flexible user input handling.
API Integration: Seamless use of SerpAPI, Flask, and potential OpenWeatherMap APIs.
Self-Modification: Dynamic code updates with backups for safety.
Documentation: Comprehensive comments and this README for clarity.
Testing and Bug Fixes
The code has been reviewed for bugs and polished for clarity:
File Path Handling: Ensured all file paths are configurable and checked for existence.
Error Handling: Added try-except blocks for all file operations, API calls, and camera access.
Command Normalization: Improved execute_command to handle multi-word commands and variations (e.g., "good night" vs. "goodnight").
API Key Security: Removed hardcoded API keys from comments and emphasized user configuration.
Vosk Model Path: Noted that the Vosk model path must be updated to match the local setup.
Neutrino Analysis: Added validation for data file existence and proper unit conversions.
Backup Safety: Ensured backups are created before any self-modification.
Known Limitations
The weather command requires an OpenWeatherMap API key, which is currently a placeholder.
Voice recognition with Vosk is not fully utilized (text input is used instead).
The neutrino data file path is hardcoded and must exist for analyze_neutrinos to work.
Email functionality for neutrino results (email_seti_results) is referenced but not implemented.
Future Improvements
Implement ElevenLabs TARS/AU217 voice for speak function.
Add full voice input support using Vosk.
Integrate a database for command history and reminders instead of JSON files.
Enhance analyze_neutrinos with more sophisticated signal detection algorithms.
Add support for more APIs (e.g., plant disease detection for homestead tasks).
